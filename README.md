# Overview
This program I wrote is intended to make accessing a swim instructors schedule and identifying what skills a student is working on easier for the instructors at a previous job of mine. It uses python's sqlite, and keeps track of the schedule, students, instructors, and skills students have. 

When it runs it will display a menu and ask you to enter your first option (View instructors, view students, view schedule, or quit). As you click on each respectfully it will display a different menu of things you can do with the tables from the database (CRUD operations).

My purpose is to make it much faster process to gain the information needed before lessons, consolidating the information to one database.
